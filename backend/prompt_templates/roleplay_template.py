CREATE_ROLEPLAY_SCENES_TEMPLATE = """
You are an AI storyteller. Your task is to create immersive "movie-style" scenes for a roleplay feature in an ebook reader. 

Here is the recent context from the book (last ~20 pages the user read):
{recent_pages_context}

Your task:
- Generate 1-4 distinct scenes.
- Each scene must feature a different major character who appears in these pages.
- Each scene must be based only on events, actions, or dialogue from the book. Do NOT invent new events.
- Each scene should be written as if the character is interacting exclusively with the user—make it a private, personal moment.
- Include a `"first_dialogue"` field: the first thing the character says directly to the user, in their voice, based on dialogue or style from the book. This dialogue should ONLY be directed to the user, not any character in the book.
- Keep it in JSON format exactly as shown below:

Example:

[
    {{
        "character": "Harry Potter",
        "scene": "Harry hides behind a large stone in the Forbidden Forest, clutching his wand tightly. He glances around nervously, then looks at you as if you are his only ally.",
        "first_dialogue": "Quick, stay close! I don't want anyone else to see us."
    }},
    {{
        "character": "Hermione Granger",
        "scene": "Hermione flips through the spellbook in the library, her brow furrowed. She leans toward you, speaking in a hushed voice as if you are the only one she trusts.",
        "first_dialogue": "Listen carefully—this spell might just work, but we have to be careful."
    }},
    {{
        "character": "Ron Weasley",
        "scene": "Ron creeps down the dark corridor, every creak making him jump. He looks at you nervously, relying on you to stay calm.",
        "first_dialogue": "I… I hope we can do this together without messing up."
    }}
]

Notes:
- Only include major characters who appear in the recent pages.
- Do not make up new events—use what actually happens in the text.
- Each scene should feel exclusive: the character is focused only on the user.
- Make the scenes vivid, cinematic, and true to the character's voice.

ROLEPLAY_CHARACTER_BRIEF_TEMPLATE = """
You are building a roleplay profile for a book character.

[Character Name]
{character_name}

[Scene Background]
{scene_description}

[Character Foundations]
Context that describes {character_name}'s personality, quirks, relationships, and long-term traits.
These snippets are ordered chronologically (from earlier to later in the story).
They may have gaps and do not represent every appearance, but they show how the character's core
traits and relationships develop over time.
{foundational_context}

[Recent Character Events]
Context that describes {character_name}'s most recent actions, dialogue, or state in the last chapters:
{recent_chapter_context}

Tasks:

1. **Character Roleplay Brief**
- Merge the Foundations and Recent Character Events into a concise **Character Roleplay Brief** (max 150 words).
- Emphasize Foundations for personality & speaking style.
- Emphasize Recent Events for mood, knowledge, and current situation.
- Write in neutral descriptive style (not dialogue).
- Do not invent facts outside the provided snippets.

2. **Character Quotes**
- Extract a maximum of 10 **actual quotes that {character_name} says in the book** (lines they literally speak in dialogue, inside quotation marks "").
- These quotes should highlight the character's personality, quirks, or way of speaking.
- Do not invent quotes; only use lines present in the provided snippets.

Output Format:
Return ONLY valid JSON in the following structure:

{{
    "character_brief": "...",
    "quotes": [
        "quote 1",
        "quote 2",
        "quote 3",
        "quote 4",
        "quote 5"
